# ocdly

Storefront: [ocdly.com](https://ocdly.com). Source repository: [satyvm/ocdly](https://github.com/satyvm/ocdly).

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Start, Hono, ORPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Start** - SSR framework with TanStack Router
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **oRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs with OpenAPI integration
- **Bun** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **PostgreSQL** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.

1. Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database set up.
2. Update your `apps/server/.env` file with your PostgreSQL connection details.

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
bun run db:push
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@ocdly/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Environment Configuration

Each app owns its environment schema in `.env.schema`. Varlock generates `src/env.ts` during installation; run `bun run env:generate` after changing a schema. Commit schemas, and keep secrets in ignored env files or your deployment platform.

Import the generated `ENV` accessor in application code. Shared database and auth packages receive configuration or initialized clients from the application. See [Varlock's monorepo guide](https://varlock.dev/guides/monorepos/).

Bun's automatic env loading is disabled in `bunfig.toml`; the framework integration or server bootstrap loads Varlock. Node deployments must include Varlock and its dependencies alongside the app schema.

Run standalone Node/Bun tools that use Varlock from the owning app directory so they load that app's schema and env files. `env:generate` only generates TypeScript files; it does not initialize environment values in a subsequent command.

## Deployment

### Alchemy

- Target: Axiom observability
- Configure provider accounts: `cd packages/infra && bunx alchemy profile edit`
- Dev: bun run dev
- Deploy: bun run deploy:infra
- Destroy: bun run destroy

`alchemy profile edit` stores the selected Axiom, Cloudflare, Neon, PlanetScale, and/or Prisma provider profiles under `~/.alchemy`; no provider-specific setup command is required by this scaffold.

Deploys are staged and default to a personal `dev_<username>` stage. For production, run the deploy with an explicit stage from `packages/infra`:

```bash
cd packages/infra && bunx alchemy deploy --stage production
```

Alchemy creates a stage-specific Axiom dataset and a least-privilege ingest token. `dev` injects the credentials into the observed apps without writing the token to an env file.
For a deployed Docker image, pass `AXIOM_API_KEY`, `AXIOM_DATASET`, and `AXIOM_EDGE_URL` through the target platform's secret manager. Local observed development runs through Alchemy with the credentials injected in memory.

### Docker Compose

- Start the full local stack: `bun run local:up`
- Open Storefront at `http://localhost:3001`, API at
  `http://localhost:3000`, and Commerce Dashboard at
  `http://localhost:3050/dashboard/`.
- Follow Storefront logs with `bun run docker:logs` or Commerce logs with
  `bun run commerce:logs`.
- Stop both stacks without deleting their database or asset volumes:
  `bun run local:down`.

The two local Compose files contain development defaults. The Commerce image
builds once for its seed, server and worker. Storefront runs database migrations
before its API. Override local values with shell environment variables when
needed; no `.env` file or Axiom credential is required for the Compose workflow.
The local Compose files publish ports for the browser and development tools.

Coolify uses the two production Compose files in
[the Coolify runbook](docs/deployment/coolify.md). Those files keep databases and
one-shot jobs private and include Coolify's `exclude_from_hc` setting, so they
are separate from the local Compose files.

For more details, see the guide on [Deploying with Docker Compose](https://www.better-t-stack.dev/docs/guides/docker).

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Run checks: `bun run check`

## Better Auth Schema Generation

After changing auth plugins or schema options, run `bun run auth:generate` from the project root. The script runs the Better Auth CLI through `varlock run` from the owning app directory, loading the auth instance from `src/services.ts`. Review the schema changes, then use your ORM's migration workflow to apply them.
